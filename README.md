CodeClause Internship CodeClauseInternship Credit Card Fraud Detection Machine Learning Model
## ABOUT:
The Credit Card Fraud Detection Problem includes modeling past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be fraud. So,this system is used to identify whether a new transaction is fraudulent or not. Our aim here is to detect 100% of the fraudulent transactions while minimizing the incorrect fraud classifications.
## Dataset:
Data set was imported from kaggle datasets
link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

## ABOUT THE MODEL:
1. The data set was firstly preprocessed and to find errors.
2. The data set was alredy decomposed using PCA.
3. The dataset was highly imbalanced so i have used techniques like oversampling and undesampling to maintain a good balance
4. Algorithms like SMOTE and NearMiss are used to achieve the above.
5. Finally the Model was made using Classifiers like Logistic Regeression, Kneighbours Classifier, RandomForestClassifiers and have chosen the best model based on accuracy score, precison and recall between two classes.
